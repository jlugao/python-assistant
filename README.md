# python-assistant

This is still a huge draft.

The idea of the project is having a assistant for code quality in python that have a nice UI for developers to understand what is
wrong or improvable in their code.


This will be a open-source self-hosted service with two parts:

- 1 - Agent to run linters
- 2 - Webserver to:
    - store results of previous runs
    - nice UI showing the code with coverage and lint errors on each line
    - show repo trends
